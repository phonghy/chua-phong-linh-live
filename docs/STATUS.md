# Project status

**Phases 0–9 are complete for the local release and requested viewer-engagement extension.** Actual TikTok reception and OBS/broadcast verification remain external setup tasks.

## Desktop packaging and in-app TikTok settings (latest)
- **TikTok username + sign key now live in Admin → Cài đặt** (`GET/PUT /api/tiktok`, SQLite `config` table, additive, `user_version` unchanged). Key is write-only; neither it nor the username is in any snapshot. `.env` values remain a fallback. **Decision:** this deliberately supersedes the earlier "credentials in ignored env files" contract (user-approved); AGENTS.md updated.
- **Bun desktop executable:** `npm run package` → `scripts/build-desktop.ts` embeds `dist/web` and compiles `apps/server/src/desktop.ts` (data dir per OS, embedded static + Range, reuse-if-running, auto-open browser). Bun 1.4.4 runs `node:sqlite`, express/ws and `tiktok-live-connector` unchanged, so no SQLite adapter was added; dev/tests remain on Node.
- **CI:** `.github/workflows/build.yml` — test job, native-runner matrix (macOS arm64, macOS Intel, Windows x64) with `scripts/smoke-desktop.mjs`, tag `v*` → GitHub Release with checksums. Actions pinned by SHA; no secrets.
- Checks run: `tsc` clean; `npm test` 23/23 (3 new credential tests); Settings UI saved/persisted in a real browser (isolated instance on a scratch DB); under Bun: server, WS snapshot, SDK import behave like Node; compiled **macOS arm64** binary passed the smoke test from an empty directory (assets, Range 206, WS, DB in data dir, persistence, second-instance reuse, busy-port fallback). `actionlint` clean. Windows and Intel binaries cross-compiled only.
- **Unverified:** the GitHub workflow has not run yet (first push/`workflow_dispatch` is the test); Windows and macOS Intel executables have not been run; binaries are unsigned/unnotarized; no new Playwright test for the Settings form (covered by API tests plus manual browser check); real TikTok reception still unverified.
- Next: push, run the workflow via `workflow_dispatch`, fix any runner-specific failure, then tag `v0.1.0`.

## Local startup convenience
- Added a root Makefile for setup, development, production build/start, tests and help; README documents TikTok configuration and connection. Setup preserves an existing `.env`.
- Verified Make target commands and setup creation/preservation using a stubbed npm in a temporary directory; `make test` passed 20 tests, `make build` passed with the existing Vite chunk-size advisory, and an isolated `make run` returned HTTP 200 for `/admin` and `/game`. The first test attempt hit a sandbox IPC restriction; rerunning outside the sandbox passed.
- Next: run `make setup`, set TikTok credentials in `.env`, run `make`, and connect via admin. Real LIVE events and OBS broadcasting remain unverified.

## Delivered
- Phaser 4.2.1 / React / TypeScript / Node 24 / SQLite npm workspace; backend-owned events/progress and sequenced WebSocket synchronization across `/admin`, `/game`, `/overlay`.
- Approved golden painted temple, independent altar/visitor art, wide/close cameras, 40 visible visitors and 180 pooled effects. Existing visual identity and original artwork are preserved.
- Free `!le`, `!nhang`, moderated `!cau`; flower offerings require TikTok gifts. `!sen` gives gift guidance without points/cooldown. Exact-once gift streak contributions and durable settings/mappings/events/prayers remain intact.
- Durable per-session **Bảng tri ân**: gift contribution points and free participation, top five each. Approved prayers score only in their original matching session; replay and mismatched sources do not score. Explicit session reset preserves lifetime progress/settings/prayers. Reconnecting to the same persisted source preserves boards.
- Vietnamese narrator uses the installed macOS **Linh** voice, synthesized to WAV server-side, played through the browser/OBS audio graph. Bounded serial voice queue, grouped gift thanks, follow/share thanks, independent volume, music ducking, silent admin preview and bootstrap/reload suppression. Missing voice retains visual thanks.
- Separate simultaneous-audience counter and once-per-session milestones at 100/250/500/1,000 then each additional 1,000. Tiered lotus/light effects and communal bow; dips/reconnects do not repeat reached thresholds. Unknown count after disconnect/restart/30 seconds without new stats. Share invitations at most every five minutes with fresh positive audience data, spaced from celebrations.
- Admin mock controls for gifts, audience and shares; truthful source labels and noninteractive TikTok instructions in stream. SDK adapter supports share and `roomUser` statistics (`total`, never cumulative `totalUser`). No messages are posted to TikTok.
- Existing looping `music.mp3` remains on the ambient control with linear gain (default 8% after master), separate ceremony and narrator controls. README covers usage, sessions, OBS, backups and voice limitations.

## Validation — latest extension
- **20 unit/integration tests pass** with the normal `npm test` command. Includes persistence/sync, cooldown/moderation, exact-once scoring/streaks, session recovery, narrator queues, audience/source/threshold/SDK fixtures and share-prompt timing.
- **14 browser tests pass**, with the benchmark intentionally skipped in the normal suite. Includes real Vietnamese WAV response, serial voice/ducking/disable, OBS-like auto-audio, bootstrap/session resets, boards, audience effects and synchronized operator flows.
- TypeScript and production build pass. Existing Vite chunk-size advisory remains. Existing local server returns HTTP 200 for health/admin/game/overlay and exposes the new contracts; narrator reports Linh available.
- Updated wide/close, desktop/mobile baselines inspected and reproduced without snapshot updates in the final suite. Native 1,000-viewer celebration and top-five/long-name mobile captures inspected. See `docs/qa/ENGAGEMENT_REVIEW.md` and `audience-1000.png`.
- **60-second hardware performance passes:** 40 visitors, gifts every 700ms, audience celebrations every 4.9s, peak 180 effects at 1080×1920. Mean **61.68 FPS**, slowest complete 60-frame window **59.94 FPS**, p95 **17.6ms**; Apple M5 / 10 cores / 24GiB / ANGLE Metal. Audio/OBS encoding excluded. See `docs/qa/benchmark.json` and `PERFORMANCE.md`; original v1 measurement retained in `benchmark-release-v1.json`.
- Generic-name native Vietnamese sample: `docs/qa/narration-sample.wav`, 3.54s mono 22,050Hz, nonzero waveform. Speech pronunciation/loudness has not been subjectively assessed.
- Terra implemented bounded backend tasks, Luna implemented client/UI, Sol reviewed complex event/session/narrator integration. Two review findings fixed with regression tests: saved TikTok boards resetting after restart/reconnect, and inherited command names such as `constructor` causing exceptions. Final targeted review found no further concrete issue.

## Phase boundaries and failures
- Phase 7 gate passed before narration: 13 unit/integration tests, eight browser checks and native/mobile inspection.
- Phase 8 gate passed before audience effects: 16 unit/integration tests, real WAV and browser narration/session/OBS-like audio checks. Fixed first-gift loss after session reset and narration enabled before initial state.
- Phase 9 gate passed with the final checks above. A concurrent Playwright output collision and one incorrect simulator-label test selector were corrected; final suites pass. Run browser suites/benchmark sequentially.

## Limits and next concrete action
- Real LIVE reception, actual gift IDs, OBS Studio capture/audio, broadcasting and subjective audio listening remain unverified. Current LIVE access is phone-only. No software-rendered or universal-hardware performance claim is made.
- Native narration currently targets macOS with Linh; other systems report voice unavailable. Only use one audible game/OBS source to avoid double playback. Begin a new session explicitly before each new LIVE; restart/reconnect intentionally preserves the latest session.
- Existing server is running and was reused at **http://127.0.0.1:3000/admin** in mock mode, with Linh available. No duplicate server was started. Data remains in ignored `data/temple.sqlite`.
- Next: use **Chạy mô phỏng**, **Gửi quà**, **Cập nhật người xem** (e.g. 1,000), **Thử chia sẻ**; enable audio in `/game` or use `/overlay?audio=1`, then listen and balance narrator/music on the intended device. For a real broadcast, configure `.env`, map actual gifts and validate received events plus OBS capture/audio.
- Deferred: themed rooms, daily activities, OBS automation, official partner integration and cloud deployment. No additional feature implementation remains in the authorized extension.
